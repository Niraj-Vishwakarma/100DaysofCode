ARRAY ROTATOION : arr[n], rotate by d times
----
APPROACH 1 :

shifting element one by one for d times
----
APPROACH 2 :

shifting d size array

APPROACH 3 : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-array-rotation-continued-reversal-algorithm/

Let AB are the two parts of the input array where A = arr[0..d-1] and B = arr[d..n-1]. The idea of the algorithm is : 
 

Reverse A to get ArB, where Ar is reverse of A.
Reverse B to get ArBr, where Br is reverse of B.
Reverse all to get (ArBr) r = BA.
