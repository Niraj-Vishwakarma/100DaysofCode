After the amazing success of Kota Factory, Jeetu bhaiya wants to test his three bright students Vaibhav, Meenal and Meena.

There are n beads on a table in a row. Each bead can be either red, green or blue. Jeetu bhaiya asked them to remove the minimum number of beads from the table such that any two neighbouring beads have different colors.

Beads in a row are considered neighboring if there are no other beads between them.

The task is to print the number of beads remaining on the table.

Since Vaibhav, Meenal and Meena are tired after the shoot, can you help them to solve the problem?

Jonas wishes to meet young Martha but he is quite old and wishes to meet her as a young man. He recently learnt that by exploiting the energy level differences between parallel universes he can become younger.

He has a long journey ahead of him as N parallel universes exist in a linear fashion with fixed position in space. He is currently on the leftmost universe (i, initially i is 1). He knows that he will only be able to meet her when only one universe remains. So he must now find a way to destroy the remaining universes.

A helpful wizard told him that whenever he steps on the very rightmost universe (N), the leftmost universe (i) gets destroyed and he gets teleported from that (N)th universe to leftmost universe that exists which is (i+1)th universe. Let array A denote energies of N parallel universes.
More formally, calculate:
